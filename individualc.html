      <h2>How I Contributed</h2>
       <p>I wanted to be sure that I had a big part in shaping the overall project for both the pilot episode and the transmedia element. My main contributions involve an animated introduction, providing market research towards justifying the target audience and shaping the group transmedia element.</p>
      <h3>Animated Intro</h3>
      <p>
      I am a passionate animator and confident in using 'Adobe After Effects.' The aim was to create a glitch effect with a hint of an atmosphere of horror. I used After Effects to add dramatic sound as the title 'Innocence' shows and have that glitch. I would then show the Coventry University logo to appear but not to animate otherwise I feel it would have looked messy. It's a quick yet effective way to open the episode.

      <h3>Market Research</h3>
      <p>
      We chose to aim the web-series for the 16-24 year-old market which needed justification. I carried out some research into teen dramas and thrillers individually and found results to justify our target market choice. I looked into 2 popular teen dramas in Misfits and Skins and 2 popular thrillers in Stranger Things and Black Mirror. I found out for the 2nd season debut for Misfits, 28.2% out of 600,000 viewers where 16-24 year olds and Skins had 60% out of 877,000 viewers in the same category.<br>
      <br>
      I then looked into the thrillers and found more data supporting our choice with season 4 of Black Mirror drawing an audience of mostly under 17's-34 year olds. Out of that category, 31% of those where 18-24 year olds and 36% where from under 17's alone. Stranger Things also showed that the majority of viewers are from the 16-24 year-old age bracket. With my market research, we could support targeting the 16-24 age demographic for the web-series.

      <h3>Materialising The Twitter Page</h3>
       <p>
      The Twitter page as the group transmedia element was a group decision, however I took it upon myself to materialise the Twitter page. I created the Twitter account @DigInnocence and designed it so that the audience can interact with the posts that certain characters from Innocence make via the Twitter page. Based on the answers given, it can shape the next episode in a certain way. I needed to make sure the Twitter page looked professional, had a trademark look to it, show examples of providing the audience with interactivity and include the appropriate hashtags to spread the word.
