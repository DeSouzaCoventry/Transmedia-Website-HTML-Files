      <h2>Digital Comic Book: Dyson's Endeavor Part 1</h2>
       <h3><a href="https://dysonendeavour.000webhostapp.com/#Home" target=_blank>Click Here To Access The Comic!</a></h3>
      <p>For my individual transmedia project, I have decided to create an interactive digital comic book being a side-story for the character I play: Bill Dyson. I used my Wacom drawing tablet and Adobe Illustrator for the drawings and Klynt to provide the story with interactive features.</p>
      <h3>Plot Insight</h3>
      <p>
      This is the first part of a side story that will have multiple chapters to maintain the suspense element. It is how a tragedy that affected a young Bill Dyson put him on the true path to maturity as the police officer hopes to hunt down the criminal responsible for the tragedy. Dyson is young and has plenty of promise for his career as part of the police but he soon realises he has much to learn before he is truly ready. This side story will not only help show this but will also lead to answers in the main story as to why Dyson is the way he is and potentially introduce characters from this side story into the main story.
      </p>
      <h3>Tools And Assets</h3>
      <p>
      In regards to the tools I used, I wanted to put my digital art skills to the test, hence why I used a Wacom drawing tablet and Adobe Illustrator for the illustrations for this comic book. It was not only key that I match the drawings of Bill Dyson to the real character appearance wise as much as I can but also to provide characters that could be realistically translated into real-life versions. I used Klynt for the interactive features as it has a range of exciting interactive material. I particularly wanted to include audio features that reads out what the characters are saying and thanks to Klynt I was able to do so. You can read my digital comic book by clicking the mini-heading.
