      <p>For the web-series we chose a theme of a teen-drama/thriller that surrounds a murder of a young University student called Ines Garcia. Ines was mysteriously murdered and Bill Dyson begins a thorough investigation with her closest 2 friends and one other observer. Flashbacks, deceit, trauma and tension leads to an exciting thriller of who is the one behind the death of Ines!</p>
      <h3>Name Justification</h3>
      <p>
      We decided on the name Innocence because ultimately whilst the ones being interrogated are under the spotlight, none of them are fully guilty and yet whether they are completely innocent is also put into question. The series also showcases real-life issues University students may be facing with very relatable characters as the centre.
      </p>
      <h3>Transmedia Element</h3>
      <p>
      In terms of making the web-series transmedia, we created an official Twitter page under the name @DigInnocence. The idea of this is for certain characters to run the Twitter page with the appropriate hashtags so the audience can interact with it. The answers from the audience are based on what they saw in the episode and certain answers will help shape the next episode. This interaction with the official Twitter gives the audience power to shape the outcome of the series.
