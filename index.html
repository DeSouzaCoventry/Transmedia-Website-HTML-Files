      <h2>Website Features</h2>
      <p>This website contains my work towards 2043MAPA: the transmedia practice module. The tasks were to use our understanding of transmedia elements and apply them to make a transmedia web series. This included a pilot episode in groups, a group transmedia element and our individual transmedia project to contribute in some ways towards the new webs series.</p>
      <p>
      The term 'transmedia' defines how one thing can contain a range of different media to interact in different ways. As digital media students, we needed to find unique digital ways to provide engaging interactivity in our web series itself and our individual projects
